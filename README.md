### Synopsis

The [tolerance package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tolerance) provides functions for estimating tolerance limits (intervals) for various univariate distributions, Bayesian normal tolerance limits, multivariate normal tolerance regions, nonparametric tolerance intervals, tolerance bands for regression settings, and analysis of variance tolerance intervals.  Visualizations in the form of histograms, scatterplots, and control charts are also available for many of these settings.    More details about the package are included in both the original [JSS](https://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v036.i05) article as well as a subsequent [Handbook of Statistics](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63431-3.00008-5) book chapter.

Other highlights:

- Includes calculations for tolerance limits (intervals) for numerous continuous and discrete distributions.

- Pointwise tolerance interval calculations for linear, nonlinear, nonparametric, and multivariate regression settings are available.

- Functions for sample size determination in normal and nonparametric settings are available.

- Includes a novel operating characteristic curve function regarding _k_-factors for tolerance intervals based on normality.

- Novel nonparametric methods are included, such as the ability to construct multivariate hyperrectangular tolerance regions for setting reference regions.

### Documentation

The [JSS](https://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v036.i05) article and the [Handbook of Statistics](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63431-3.00008-5) book chapter both provide documentation about the tolerance package.  The [RJ](https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2016-041) article provides an extensive overview of most of the normal-based procedures available within the tolerance package.  Moreover, the [help file](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tolerance) also documents the references used for each function.

### Examples

Additional examples for the tolerance package are currently being developed for a Shiny app.

### Installation

Released and tested versions of tolerance are available via the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) network, and can be installed from within R via

```R
install.packages("tolerance")
```

### Support

The [issue tickets at the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dsy109/tolerance/issues)
are the primary bug reporting interface.  As with the other web resources,
previous issues can be searched as well.
