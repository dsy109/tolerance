### Synopsis

The [HoRM package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HoRM) provides supplemental functions and datasets for the book [_Handbook of Regression Methods_](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Regression-Methods/Young/p/book/9781498775298) by [Derek S. Young](https://young.as.uky.edu/).  Illustrations of the datasets are included in both that textbook as well as the accompanying [Shiny app](https://horm.as.uky.edu/).

Other highlights:

- Includes 21 real datasets, each of which is analyzed in the book _Handbook of Regression Methods_.

- Includes some original functions, such as for the regressogram and power functions for the general linear F-test.

### Documentation

The book _Handbook of Regression Methods_ provides documentation about the HoRM package.  Moreover, the [help file](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HoRM) also documents the original sources for each dataset.

### Examples

All examples in _Handbook of Regression Methods_ are demonstrated in the [Shiny app](https://horm.as.uky.edu/).

### Installation

Released and tested versions of Rcpp are available via the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) network, and can be installed from within R via

```R
install.packages("HoRM")
```

### Support

The [issue tickets at the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dsy109/HoRM/issues)
are the primary bug reporting interface.  As with the other web resources,
previous issues can be searched as well.
